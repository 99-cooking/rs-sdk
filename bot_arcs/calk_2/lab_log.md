## Progression Strategy

The desert-journey arc will:
1. **Phase 1: Travel** - Sell shortbow at Lumbridge general store, pay 10gp toll, enter Al Kharid
2. **Phase 2: Thieving** - Pickpocket men until ~200gp accumulated
3. **Phase 3: Buy First Scimitar** - Purchase and equip bronze scimitar (32gp)
4. **Phase 4: Combat Training** - Fight warriors, eat kebabs, train combat
5. **Phase 5: Gear Upgrades** - Auto-upgrade scimitars as Attack increases

The script will automatically cycle between activities based on:
- GP level (thieve if low, combat if comfortable)
- HP level (eat kebabs, buy more if out)
- Attack level (buy better scimitar when available)
